Hi! I'm Kevin Luna and this is my code Kata, here I want to show you + 20 test proposed for https://tddmanifesto.com/exercises/
First Kata FizzBuzz:
Requirements
1. Write a “fizzBuzz” method that accepts a number as input and returns it as a String.

Notes:

start with the minimal failing solution
keep the three rules in mind and always write just sufficient enough code
do not forget to refactor your code after each passing test
write your assertions relating to the exact requirements
2. For multiples of three return “Fizz” instead of the number

3. For the multiples of five return “Buzz”

4. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”.
